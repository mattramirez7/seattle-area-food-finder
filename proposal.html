                The app will be designed to help its users figure out what restaurants to eat at in Seattle. The target users will be people living in Seattle or people visting Seattle. Lists of restaurants will be able to be made. For example, a list of favorite restaurants a user has visited. Users will be able to leave descriptions/comments on restaurants. This can be anything from a personal review, what users have heard about a restaurant, food they thought was good or want to try at a restaurant etc. The page the user makes can be shared to others. If two people are vegetarians, gluten free or have other dietary needs, they will be able to share restaurants with each other. 
            </p>

                This app will be more personalized to a user. Using this app will help users find a place to eat and a reason to eat there. Many lists online for places to eat at in Seattle will not have the same impact as getting a list of recommendations from a friend. New students at UW can ask others that have been in Seattle to see their page created on this app to get a more personal list that can be more useful that a general overview that other apps give.
