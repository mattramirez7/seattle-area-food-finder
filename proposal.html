                The topic that we are presenting is restaurants in Seattle, and how we can improve the accessibility of information related to these restaurants so that people can find the restaurant experience that they are looking for, as well as sharing information about these restaurants with other people. 
                Currently, there are restaurant review applications and sites, but none of these sites offer features that allow users to share and create lists of restaurants, or track restaurants that they want to share with their friends or visit. Additionally, these apps are not personalized to users, which 
                means the features are not intuitive enough to every individual user. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A previous attempt to address this issue could be an application like Yelp, which covers restaurants and other services across the world. For now, our application will specialize in restaurants, and be personalized to every 
                individual user, as well as offering unique features to distinguish us from previous attempts to solve the problem.

            <p>
                The purpose of our app will be to help users figure out what restaurants to eat at in Seattle. Users will be able to create and store lists of restaurants. For example, a user may want to track restaurants they have visited, and make a list of their favorites or recommendations for other users. 
                Users will also be able to leave descriptions and comments on the restaurants. This can be anything from a personal review, what users have heard about a restaurant, food they thought was good or want to try at a restaurant, etc. The page the user makes can be shared to others. 
                If two people are vegetarians, gluten free or have other dietary needs, they will be able to share restaurants with each other. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This app will be more personalized to a user. Using this app will help users find a place to eat and a reason to eat there. Many lists online for places to eat at in Seattle will not have the same impact as getting a list of recommendations from a friend. 
                New students at UW can ask others that have been in Seattle to see their page created on this app to get a more personal list that can be more useful than a general overview that other apps give.
