                The topic that we are choosing to focus on is restaurants in the Seattle area, and how we can improve the accessibility of information related to these restaurants so that people can find the restaurant experience that they are looking for.
                We want users to have a platform where they can easily track and customize lists of their favorite restaurants, restaurants they want to try, and anything else that they want to track. Additionally users can use this app to search and find specific 
                restaurants, whether they choose to do that through the search function or by finding restaurants near them using the map feature. Currently, there are restaurant review applications and sites, but none of these sites offer features that allow 
                users to share and create lists of restaurants, or track restaurants that they want to share with their friends or visit. Additionally, these apps are not personalized to users, which means the features are not intuitive enough to every individual user.

                A previous attempt to address this issue could be an application like Yelp, which covers restaurants and other services across the world. For now, our application will specialize in restaurants, and be personalized to every 
                individual user, while also offering unique features to distinguish us from previous attempts to solve the problem.

            <h3>App Description</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of our app will be to help users figure out and track what restaurants to eat at in Seattle. Users will be able to create and store lists of restaurants. For example, a user may want to track restaurants they have visited, make a list of their favorite restaurants, or 
                offer restaurants recommendations to friends and family. Seattle Area Food Finder helps users easily search and find information about restaurants in the Seattle Area, whilch also giving them the option to save and store these restaurants 
                in customizable lists. They are also able to use our map feature to find restaurants near them, or use the map to look for restaurants that they are interested in. Users can customize and name their lists however they'd like, whether that means
                keeping track of restaurants that cater to specific dietary concerns, specific types of cuisine (chinese, italian, japanese, etc.), or different types of restaurants and services (bars, delivery, etc.). This application offers users a tool to easily track
                and manage all the information they want about restaurants in Seattle.

                This app is more personalized to each user, giving them full control over how they choose to create and customize their own lists, or use other features such as the interactive map and search function.
                Using this app will help users find a place to eat and a reason to eat there. Anyone can use our application, whether it is students recommending restaurants to their friends, users looking for a quick late-night
                bite, and anything else related to restaurants and food in the greater Seattle Area.
