# INFO 340 Project: Seattle Area Food Finder 🍽️

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.💻🏫<br>

I assisted in building this static web application alongside two other developers utilizing React.js, firebase for hosting, and a database representing Seattle-based restaurants and eateries.
